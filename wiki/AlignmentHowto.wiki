#summary Using alignment.

*NOT YET TESTED* due to current weather conditions. Use at your own risk.

= Alignment =

By default, the mount is aligned with the last sync point you performed after connecting the mount. If you did'nt sync any point, there would not be any correction. Each time you sync a point, it is by default added to the set of sync points ('Add point on sync' switch is set by default). The last sync point is displayed in the alignment tab. Sync points may also be saved and restored from a 'Data file': this is useful for permanent observatories. The data file is automatically loaded when you connect the mount, which means that if the file exists, you use a permanent observatory. This file has a simple and self-explanatory XML content, so you could edit it by hand.    

*Nearest Point* alignment mode simply searches in the set of sync points for the nearest one and use its sync data to perform a simple alignement correction (add RA/DEC deltas). 

*N-Star* alignment mode uses the algorithm described in [http://www.geocities.jp/toshimi_taki/matrix/matrix_method_rev_e.pdf Taki's paper] on page 33. It computes a correction matrix based on at least 2 sync points. Actually the 3 nearest sync points are used here. This is a difference with the alignment mode of the EQMod project, where a triangle of sync points is selected  so that the distance of its center to the target is minimal.

== Steps for using N-Star alignment in Kstars ==
  # Connect he mount.
  # Set the scope location with the one defined in Kstars: simply press 'Update' in the 'scope location' in the 'Site Management' tab.
  # Switch to 'No Alignment' in the 'Alignment' tab.
  # Add sync points:
    * Track to a star of your choice
    * Align it in a reticle using 'Move N/S' and 'Move 'E/W' of the motion tab
    * Use 'Sync' in kstars on the star you choosed to add a sync point 
    * At least two sync points should be defined (otherwise nearest point is choosen)
    * You could empty the set at any time if you wish to restart
  # Switch to 'N-Star' in the 'Alignment' tab when done.

Subsequent Track/Slew commands will now be 'N-Star' aligned, and the correction displayed in the Message window: you could check if it is safe and abort motion if not. Note that RA/DEC coords will now be slightly changing even when RA tracking, as your mount is not perfectly polar-aligned. An estimation of the misalignment could be made by pointing to the pole: if you switch back to 'No Alignment', the mount reticle in kstars should then almost point to where your mount does.
